# EPO_HR_Dashboard

#This is a Shiny dashboard containing visualizations of key HR statistics from the European Patent Office. 

#The data are publically available on the EPO website (https://www.epo.org/about-us/annual-reports-statistics/social-reports.html). They are to be found in 11 reports, published annualy by the EPO, containing key statistics about EPO staff. 
#The reports are in PDF format and the data in question are in the form of tables in the PDF files. 
#In order to extract the data, I used the pdftools R package, which converts PDFs to vectors. I then wrote a number of functions, catering to the various tables whose data I wanted to scrape. 

#Following data scraping, cleaning and manipulation, I created 13 interactive visualizations using plotly and compiled everything into a simple Shiny dashboard. 

#You can look at the dashboard by running the following command in your R environment:

library(shiny)
